"After Training" (Final Evaluation Dashboard)

This is the static report generated after a training run is complete. It is the final judgment on the experiment's viability.

1. Experiment Summary

	•	Experiment Name: [Text]
	•	Final Status: [Text] (e.g., "COMPLETED", "STOPPED BY USER", "ERROR")
	•	Total Training Time: [Text] (e.g., "04:38:52")
	•	Best Model Checkpoint: [Link] (e.g., /models/Run_10m_HeikenAshi_ViT_Heal_v2/best_model.pth)

2. Parameter Configuration (Recap)

	•	Static Display: A read-only view of all the parameters selected in the "Before Training" form. This is essential for reproducibility, so you know exactly what settings produced this result.

3. Final Performance Plots (Full History)

	•	Plot 1: Loss vs. Epoch (Train & Validation): The complete, high-resolution history of training and validation loss, making it easy to see the exact point of overfitting.
	•	Plot 2: Prediction Correctness vs. Epoch (Train & Validation): The complete history of our primary "healing" metric.

4. Backtesting & Financial Viability Report (Test Set)

This is the ultimate test. These metrics are calculated by running the best saved model over the test set (data it has never seen) and simulating trades.
	•	Plot 3: Equity Curve: A line chart showing the cumulative P/L (Portfolio Value) over the test period vs. a "Buy and Hold" benchmark of the underlying (e.g., NIFTY 50).
	•	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
	◦	Total Return (%)
	◦	Sharpe Ratio
	◦	Sortino Ratio (focuses on downside volatility)
	◦	Calmar Ratio (Total Return vs. Max Drawdown)
	◦	Maximum Drawdown (%): The largest peak-to-trough drop in portfolio value.
	•	Trade Statistics:
	◦	Total Trades: [Number]
	◦	Win Rate (%): (Number of Winning Trades / Total Trades)
	◦	Loss Rate (%): (Number of Losing Trades / Total Trades)
	◦	Profit Factor: (Gross Profit / Gross Loss)
	◦	Average Win ($/Pts)
	◦	Average Loss ($/Pts)

5. Deep Dive: Dynamic System Analysis (Full History)

This section provides a post-mortem on our unique architecture's behavior over the entire training run.
	•	Plot 4: Correction Factor History: A full time-series plot of the Correction Factor. This shows when and how oftenthe system felt it was "wounded" and applied corrections.
	•	Plot 5: Error Component Histogram: A histogram showing the distribution of the four error components (d_vec, theta_vec, theta_PCA1, theta_PCA2). This tells us what type of error was most common.
	•	Plot 6: Frame Shift Stability Histogram: A histogram of the Frame Shift Error values. A sharply peaked-at-zero distribution is good (stable frame). A wide distribution is bad (chaotic frame).

6. Sample Prediction Analysis (Test Set)

	•	Visual Grid: Show a grid of 10-20 sample predictions from the test set.
	•	Each Sample Includes:
	1	Input (Dynamic Plane): The snapshot fed to the model.
	2	Model's Prediction: The predicted vector/image.
	3	Realized Outcome: The actual vector/image that occurred.
	4	Error Breakdown: (e.g., d_vec=0.1, theta_vec=5°, frame_shift=2°).
	5	Trade Result: (e.g., "Correct (Profit)", "Incorrect (Loss)").
	•	Purpose: To build qualitative intuition. You can look at why the model failed. Did it fail during high frame shifts? Did it misjudge direction or just magnitude?
